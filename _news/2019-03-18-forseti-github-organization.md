title: Coming soon! Forseti GitHub Organization
author: Ryan Ismert

Greetings Forseti Community,

We want to share some exciting news - the Forseti GitHub repository will soon have a new home! In the next couple of weeks, we'll move from the ‘GoogleCloudPlatform’ Organization to our very own ‘Forseti’ Organization. This will make it easier for us to gather repositories for related projects (like the upcoming Config Validator) under the Forseti umbrella. 

Don't worry - all your old URLs will continue to work! GitHub will helpfully redirect all traffic to the location to our new location when we transfer the main forseti-security repo.

We'll provide more concrete details next week as we finalize our timing.  

Thanks!

Forseti Team
